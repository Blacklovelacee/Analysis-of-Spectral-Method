# Analysis-of-Spectral-Method

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. They describe two methods: the **Spectral Method** (SM) and the **Finite Difference** (FD). Both this methods are applied to the time-independent cases. But code for SM can be also used for solving time-dependent ones.

In the folder **_Other_**, you can find comparisons between the two methods (FD and SM), as well as additional experiments exploring how the results of the Spectral Method depend on its parameters.
